<p>Aspen has hooks that allow you to influence program execution. Hooks are
functions or methods that you write, and there are six kinds of them:</p>

<pre>def startup(website):
    return website

def inbound_early(request):
    return request

def inbound_late(request):
    return request

def outbound_early(response):
    return response

def outbound_late(response):
    return response

def shutdown(website):
    return website</pre>

<p>They don&rsquo;t need to be named startup, inbound_early, etc. Each can
return the object it was given, or a new request/response/website object. You
can also return None if you want to stick with the same object. Furthermore,
inbound and outbound hooks are encouraged to raise <a
    href="/response/">Response objects</a>.</p>

<p>In between the inbound_early and inbound_late hooks, the request is safely
translated to the filesystem, with the result at <code>request.fs</code>.</p>

<p>In between the outbound_early and outbound_late hooks, <a
    href="/nice-errors/">nice error messages</a> happen.</p>

<p>Hooks are global, meaning every hook touches every request/response.</p>

<p>Hooks are registered using API on <a href="/api/website/">the website
    object</a> that is placed in the namespace of your configuration files and
simplates.</p>
