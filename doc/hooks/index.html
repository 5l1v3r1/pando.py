<p>Aspen has hooks that allow you to influence program execution. Hooks are
functions or methods that you write, and there are six kinds of them:</p>

<pre>def startup(website):
    return website

def inbound_early(request):
    return request

def inbound_late(request):
    return request

def outbound_early(response):
    return response

def outbound_late(response):
    return response

def shutdown(website):
    return website</pre>

<p>They don&rsquo;t need to be named startup, inbound_early, etc. Each can
return the object it was given, or a new request/response/website object. You
can also return None if you want to stick with the same object. Furthermore,
inbound and outbound hooks are encouraged to raise <a
    href="/response/">Response objects</a>.</p>

<p>In between the inbound_early and inbound_late hooks, the request is safely
translated to the filesystem, with the result at <code>request.fs</code>.</p>

<p>In between the outbound_early and outbound_late hooks, <a
    href="/nice-errors/">nice error messages</a> happen.</p>

<p>Hooks are global, meaning every hook touches every request/response.</p>


<h3>hooks.conf</h3>

<p>Hooks are specified in colon notation in a <code>hooks.conf</code> file,
with <a href="/form-feed/">ASCII form feeds</a> to delineate pages. There is
one page for each kind of hook. You can use <code>#</code> for comments.
Also, any additional page beyond the sixth are ignored, so you could put
documentation in there too as needed.</p>


<h4>Example</h4>

<p>Here is an example <code>hooks.conf</code> file:</p>

<pre># I don't have anything to run on startup.

^L

# do authentication; adds a 'user' attribute to request
mypackage.auth:inbound

# this adds a 'blah' attribute to the request object
mypackage.sub.another:blah
</pre>


<h4>Layering</h4>

<p>The <code>hooks.conf</code> file is taken from three locations:</p>

<ol>
    <li><code>/etc/aspen/hooks.conf</code></li>
    <li><code>~/.aspen/hooks.conf</code></li>
    <li><code>./.aspen/hooks.conf</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Hooks are run top to bottom in each file, in the order given above. So, for
example, the last inbound_late hook defined in
<code>./.aspen/etc/hooks.conf</code> is your last chance to touch the request
object. The first outbound_early hook in <code>/etc/aspen/hooks.conf</code> is
your first chance to touch the response object.</p>
