<p class="warning"><b>Warning:</b> This API is guaranteed to change before Aspen
1.0.</p>

<p>Aspen <code>Response</code> objects are subclasses of
<code>Exception</code>. Yeah, seriously. All HTTP <a
href="/request/">requests</a> in Aspen end with <code>raise Response</code>.
The idea is that if you&rsquo;re using Aspen as designed, then any
<code>Response</code> you raise yourself is going to be a non-200 response. If
you want a 200 response, then you should just let the Aspen <a
href="">simplates</a> machinery run its course. One nice benefit is that we can
pinpoint exactly where in your code each request ended. Set <a
href="/cli/"><code>-vDEBUG</code></a> to see this info.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the signature for the Response constructor:</p>

<pre>def __init__(self, code=200, body='', headers=None):
    """Takes an int, a string, and a dict (or list of tuples).

        - code        an HTTP response code, e.g., 404
        - body        the message body as a string
        - headers     a Headers instance

    Code is first because when you're raising your own Responses, they're
    usually error conditions. Body is second because one more often wants
    to specify a body without headers, than a header without a body.

    """</pre>

<p>The <a href="/request/">Headers</a> object is the same as on
<code>Request</code> objects.</p>
