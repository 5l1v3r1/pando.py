<p class="warning"><b>Warning:</b> This API is guaranteed to change before Aspen
1.0.</p>

<p>There is a <code>response</code> object in the second and third <a
    href="/simplates">simplate</a> pages with this constructor:</p>

<pre>def __init__(self, code=200, body='', headers=None):
    """Takes an int, a string, and a dict (or list of tuples).

        - code        an HTTP response code, e.g., 404
        - body        the message body as a string
        - headers     a Headers instance

    Code is first because when you're raising your own Responses, they're
    usually error conditions. Body is second because one more often wants
    to specify a body without headers, than a header without a body.

    """</pre>

<p>The <a href="/request/">Headers</a> object is the same as on
<code>Request</code> objects.</p>

<p>You can import the <code>Response</code> object from the <code>aspen</code>
package:</p>

<pre>from aspen import Response</pre>

<p>If you like, you can instantiate a new response object in the second
simplates page rather than using the one provided. Whatever is named
&ldquo;response&rdquo; at the end of that page will be what Aspen attempts to
send back out to the client. Additionally, <code>aspen.Response</code> objects
are subclasses of <code>Exception</code>, so you can also end the request at
any time with <code>raise Response</code>.</p>
