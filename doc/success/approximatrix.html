<p>&ldquo;I saw your <a
    href="http://blip.tv/pyohio/aspen-a-next-generation-web-framework-5436552">talk
    at PyOhio</a> this past summer and had the pleasure of joining you for
lunch following your talk at Chipotle. After PyOhio was over, I decided to give
Aspen a try firsthand, and I was found it a pleasure to work with. I have since
converted my small business's website from a cluttered, obsolete Plone
installation to a very clean Aspen implementation. The site is at <a
    href="http://approximatrix.com">http://approximatrix.com</a>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The site is almost entirely static with the exception of the News.
The goal was to show News from the site itself and also from a product's site,
which was available through an RSS feed. I was able to build an RSS feed using
Aspen pretty easily. Next, to get the news stories from two sites to appear on
the front page, I simply used the feedparser module to request the news feed
from the product's site and the site's own rss feed and assemble the page, all
via Aspen. Not particularly complicated, but it did simplify creating and
maintaining a simple small business home page.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway, I just wanted to share and thank you for the hard work on
Aspen. The whole framework was easy to use, especially for someone with
minimal web development experience like myself. I look forward to seeing and
hearing more about it!&rdquo;</p>
