========================================
    ~~VERSION~~ -- ~~DATE~~
========================================

This release adds daemonization functionality to Aspen, using Walter Dörwald's
ll.daemon module. This marks a shift in emphasis from Aspen as a development
environment to Aspen as a production server. From here to 1.0 the API should be
more or less stable as we focus on configuration for deployment, testing,
documentation, security, and optimization.


========================================
    0.5 -- December 4, 2006
========================================

This release implements automatic restarting when source files change in
debugging and development modes (issue 10; see also: lib537).

The other major change here is to the protocol for handler rules: they now take
a path instead of a file object. This means that handlers can be used for
directories as well as files (issue 9). As such, I've reimplemented default
resource serving as a handler, and have also added a directory browsing handler.


========================================
    0.4 -- December 2, 2006
========================================

Aspen now speaks pure WSGI, rather than the slight superset it spoke before. If
you want the superset, include httpy in your middleware stack:

This release also includes a few minor improvements:

  - Obsolete README.aspen files are now removed automatically.
  - The paths in the GIF image are now ordered properly.
  - Aspen now also adds lib/python2.x/site-packages to sys.path.


========================================
    0.3.1 -- November 30, 2006
========================================

This release addresses some minor issues raised in producing the "Five
Development Models" screencast.


========================================
    0.3 -- November 17, 2006
========================================

This is the first release of Aspen. This is alpha-quality software, and this
release is aimed at Python web enthusiasts. Aspen represents the culmination of
about two years of design and development effort. This is my best attempt at a
system for building and deploying many highly heterogenous websites.
