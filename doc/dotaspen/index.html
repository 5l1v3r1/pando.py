<p>Aspen uses a <code>.aspen</code> hidden directory in your website root as a
catchall for files that don&rsquo;t belong in your actual URL hierarchy.  Think
of it as your site&rsquo;s junk drawer.</p>

<p>Previous versions of Aspen used a similar directory (cleverly named __) as a
virtualenv with a UNIX-y userland layout. So conf files were under
<code>etc/</code>, modules under <code>lib/python/</code>, and templates under
<code>etc/templates/</code>. For reasons of versioning and deployment (most of
which were first put into my head by <a
    href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/web-sig/2007-March/002526.html">Jim
    Fulton</a>), it turns out to be better for <code>.aspen</code> to be flat,
and any sandboxing to happen above and outside of your website root.</p>

<h4>configuration files</h4>

<p>Aspen will read <code><a href="/aspen.conf/">aspen.conf</a></code> and
<code><a href="/hooks/">hooks.conf</a></code> files from
<code>.aspen</code>.</p>


<h4>Python modules</h4>

<p>The <code>.aspen</code> directory is placed on <code>sys.path</code> during
startup, so you can place Python modules directly inside of this directory and
they will be available to your <a href="/hooks/">hooks</a> and <a
    href="/simplates/">simplates</a>.</p>

<p>This is most helpful for pure-Python modules. C extension modules would need
to be recompiled on different platforms. My preference there is to include the
source code in <code>.aspen</code>, and build/install those into a short-lived
virtualenv as part of deployment. You could also use the Python packaging
tools, of course, either with the system Python or with a long-lived
virtualenv.</p>


<h4>Template bases and includes</h4>

<p>The <a href="/templating/">template page</a> of simplates will look in
<code>.aspen</code> for base templates for <code>{&#37;&nbsp;extends&nbsp;%}</code> and file
snippets for <code>{&#37; include
    %}</code>. You can specify relative paths there, so
    if you would like to add a little structure to <code>.aspen</code> here you
    can.</p>
