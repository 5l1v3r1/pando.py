<p>Aspen simplates support content negotiation. If a file has no file
extension, then it can have multiple content pages, and the order they appear
in will determine their priority in <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec12.html">HTTP content
    negotiation</a>. Joe Gregorio&rsquo;s <a
    href="http://code.google.com/p/mimeparse/source/browse/trunk/mimeparse.py?r=22">content
    negotiation module</a> is vendored in to do the heavy lifting). The format
of the file is like this:</p>

<pre>import foo, json

&#94;L
data = foo.bar(request)

&#94;L #!pystache text/plain
{&#123; data }}

&#94;L application/json
{&#123; json.dumps(data) }}</pre>

<p>The first two pages of the file are logic pages, after which may appear an
unlimited number of content pages. The first line of each content page is the
so-called &ldquo;specline,&rdquo; where you must specify the media type of that
content page. You may optionally specify <a href="/simplates/rendered/">a
    renderer</a> on the specline as well.</p>

<p>If a file <i>does</i> have a file extension, then it is a <a
    href="/simplates/rendered/">rendered simplate</a> with a media type
computed from the file extension. It is a SyntaxError for a file to have both
an extension and multiple content pages.</p>

<p>Files named &ldquo;index&rdquo; are included in resolving the default file
to use for a directory.</p>
