<p>Aspen comes with a utility called <code>thrash</code> that restarts a
process whenever it dies. It is installed along with the <code>aspen</code>
executable, via setuptools.</p>

<p>You can configure <code>aspen</code> to die whenever module files or files
under a <code>.aspen</code> hidden directory in your website root change. That
hidden directory is where you put template bases and includes, etc. To set this
up, create an <a href="/aspen.conf/"><code>aspen.conf</code></a> file with this
content:</p>

<pre>[aspen]
changes_kill = yes</pre>

<p>This is how Aspen supports the common case of restarting a server in
development when files change. In production you should use something like <a
    href="http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html">daemontools</a> or <a
    href="http://www.supervisord.org">supervisord</a>. Note that <a
    href="/simplates/">simplate</a> files are automatically reloaded without a
server restart whenever they change, both in development and production.</p>
