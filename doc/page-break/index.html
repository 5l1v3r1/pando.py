<p>The <code>^L</code> character is an <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_break#Form_feed">ASCII page 
    break</a>, also called:</p>

<ul>
    <li>form feed</li>
    <li>\f</li>
    <li>12</li>
    <li>0xC</li>
</ul>

<p>Aspen uses the ASCII page break to split <a href="/simplates/">simplates</a>
into pages.</p>


<h3>How to Type a Page Break</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not comfortable working with page breaks, then Aspen is not
for you. That said, here are some notes on various editors:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Vim</th>
        <td>Ctrl-L (in insert mode)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Emacs</th>
        <td>C-q C-l</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>UltraEdit</th>
        <td>There is a "Page Break" option on the "Insert"
            menu. You should remap Ctrl-L to that.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>TextMate, etc.</th>
        <td>???</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Please <a href="mailto:chad@zetaweb.com">email me</a> if you have any 
additions to that list or if you need help figuring it out for your editor.</p>

Need mongo first ...

<p>If you&rsquo;re not comfortable working with page breaks, then Aspen is not
for you. That said, I&rsquo;ve put up a community-edited page to <a
    href="/page-break/editors/">track editor support</a> for page breaks.</p>

-->


<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>Yes, Aspen uses a control character that may be new to you. This is a design
tradeoff. The page break is a perfect fit semantically (a simplate is one file
with several &ldquo;pages&rdquo;), and it is easy to type. However, the current
tool support is weak in the long tail.</p>


<h4>Tool Support</h4>

<p>Emacs has good support for page breaks. It actually provides for <a
    href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Pages.html">navigating
    through a file based on the page breaks</a> (this is how I learned of them,
actually: <a href="http://barry.warsaw.us/">Barry Warsaw</a> uses them in the
email package in the standard library). UltraEdit has the nicest presentation
of them I&rsquo;ve seen, but you have to configure your key mappings to use
Ctrl-L for it. Page breaks work fine in Vim, though there&rsquo;s no special
treatment. Other editors may be less friendly. Notepad is pretty hopeless.</p>

<p>Ideally, one would be able to configure an editor to use different syntax
highlighting for different pages in a file. For Aspen simplates, one would want
the first two (optional) pages in a file to be Python, and the third to vary by
file extension.</p>

<p>Web browsers don&rsquo;t render page breaks, so any time you want to put a
simplate code snippet on a website you have two options:</p>

<ul>

    <li>Use an actual page break, which will be confusingly invisible on the
    website, but will work if copied and pasted</li>

    <li>Change the page break to "^" "L", which will show in the browser, but
    will confusingly break when copied and pasted into an editor</li>

</ul>


<h4>Alternatives</h4>

<p>I did have a version of simplates at one point that used a goofy comment
string to delimit pages, something like:</p>

<pre>#&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;</pre>

<p>This is maybe easier for newbies to understand, but it&rsquo;s ugly and
harder to type. You could make it easier to type with a macro, but then
you&rsquo;ve made it harder for newbies again, and it&rsquo;s still ugly. The
page break is so cute: <img src="/favicon.ico" /></p>

<p>If you like simplates but dislike the page break, then you have until Aspen
1.0 to suggest something that works perfectly with existing tools <i>and</i>
isn&rsquo;t ugly.</p>
