<p>It is a primary design goal for Aspen to elegantly support both threaded and
cooperatively scheduled concurrency models. Right now everything is done except
the &ldquo;elegantly&rdquo; part. You have:</p>

<ul>
    
    <li>the <a href="https://github.com/jamwt/diesel">diesel</a> event loop
    (wraps greenlet)</li>

    <li>a <code>diesel.thread(func, *a, **kw)</code> call for one-off
    threads</li>

    <li>non-blocking <a
        href="https://github.com/jamwt/diesel/tree/experimental/diesel/protocols">protocol
        implementations</a> of varying quality bundled with diesel</li>

</ul>

<p>See <a href="http://sync.in/aspen-concurrency">this design doc</a> for
details on where things are headed in terms of wrapping these in Aspen.</p>
