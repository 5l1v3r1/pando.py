<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>Yes, you have to learn a new control character to use Aspen and simplates.
This is a design tradeoff.</p>

<p>The points in favor of the form feed are that it fits semantically (a
simplate is one file with several &ldquo;pages&rdquo;), it is easy to type, and
it is little-used otherwise. The one other use of it that I know of is in
Emacs, where you can <a
    href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Pages.html">page
    through a file</a> based on the form feeds. This actually harmonizes well
with Aspen&rsquo;s use of the character.</p>

<p>The problems with using form feed are that it is unfamiliar to people
(&ldquo;I need a tutorial to type this character?&rdquo;) and that it
doesn&rsquo;t show up in a web browser, so any time you want to put a simplate
code snippet on a website you have two options:</p>

<ul>

    <li>Use an actual form feed, which will be confusingly invisible on the
    website</li>

    <li>Change the form feed to "^" "L", which will confusingly break when
    copied and pasted into an editor</li>

</ul>

<p>A third problem is that editors don&rsquo;t support automatically switching
syntax highlighting for different pages within a file, so you have to do that
manually.</p>

<p>I take the second and third objections more seriously than the first.
Reviving a control character that has fallen on hard times is quirky and fun,
but adding undue friction to tutorials and daily editing is lame.</p>

<p>Regarding the second objection, I actually tried using a goofy comment
string at one point, something like:</p>

<pre>#&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;</pre>

<p>This answers the copy/paste objection, but is harder to type directly. You
could configure a macro for this, but to me that&rsquo;s more of a burden to
new users than explaining how to type ctrl-L.</p>

<p>The bottom line, however, is that I haven&rsquo;t found a character that has
the same <i>soul</i> as the form feed. Look at him!  He&rsquo;s so cute: <img
src="/favicon.ico" />

<p>Maybe some day browsers will display the form feed in a way that is
sensible. Maybe some day text editors will support highlighting different
pages of a file differently. Maybe some day the lowly form feed will get the
respect it deserves&mdash;or maybe some day someone will suggest an alternative
that is obviously better. But until then, form feed has a place in Aspen
simplates.</p>


<h3>Working with Form Feed</h3>

<p>The <code>^L</code> character is an <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_break#Form_feed">ASCII form
    feed</a>, also called:</p>

<ul>
    <li>page break</li>
    <li>\f</li>
    <li>12</li>
    <li>0xC</li>
</ul>

<p>Aspen uses <code>^L</code> to split <a href="/simplates/">simplates</a> and
the <a href="/hooks/">hooks.conf</a> file into sections. If memory serves, I
first saw it in Barry Warsaw's email package in the standard library. Barry <a
    href="http://barry.warsaw.us/elisp/">uses Emacs</a>, which supports <a
    href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Pages.html">paging
    through a file</a> based on the form feeds in it.</p>

<p>Here is how to type <code>^L</code> in various editors:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Vim</th>
        <td>Ctrl-L (in insert mode)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Emacs</th>
        <td>C-q C-l</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>UltraEdit</th>
        <td>If I remember right, there is a "Page Break" option on the "Insert"
            menu. You&rsquo;d probably want to remap that in the long
            term.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>TextMate, etc.</th>
        <td>???</td>
    </tr>
</table>
